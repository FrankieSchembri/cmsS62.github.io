## Geography of the Post

The purpose is to archive all the US post offices possible, and it seems that intended audience is the general public, though stamp collectors would find it most interesting. Not all post offices that have ever existed are included, since some lack record in the GNIS. It seems like the post offices presented exactly opened and closed as stated, but this is not the case, since if there were multiple openings and closings, only the final closing date is represented. Therefore, the lifespan of a given postoffice might be overrepresented. Likewise, looking at the map, we cannot tell what proportion of the postoffices have been mapped; we need to look to the left to understand the percentages mapped. We can see that the story told is biased: here, the narrative is generally true, but it has not been adjusted for the percentage mapped. Also without contextualization, the map asks for a basic understanding of Westward expansion in the US. That would be a nice thing to include. 

I feel like a lot of the narratives Iâ€™ve heard about Westward expansion are individual-centric (journals, diaries, etc.), whereas this presents a systemic overview of expansion. The overall idea is similar (boom, followed by local busts resulting in ghost towns), but the information used to tell that story is vastly different.
