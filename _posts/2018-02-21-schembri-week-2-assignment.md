## The Geography of the Post - Schembri comments

As mentioned in the site’s description, the national post office was the largest communications network in the U.S. during the nineteenth century, and afterwards, to a certain extent. This makes tracking its expansion and contraction valuable in analyzing the U.S.’s westward expansion during this time period. In comparing it with earlier and later maps of the same locations, users can examine the data in context of where major cities and infrastructure projects were located over the course of U.S. history. 

The site is built in a way that is understandable to a general audience, and so any interested party could plausibly use the data, but it seems to be more likely to be used by parties interested in the history of the U.S., the history of the U.S. post office and networks of information in general, and the effect of U.S. expansion on the infrastructure and cities of the modern North American west. 

The site maps the locations, names, and opening/closing dates of 14,000 U.S. post offices west of the hundredth meridian during the period between 1847 and 1902. The description states that the project makes use of data compiled by postal historian and philatelist Richard Helbock in United States Post Offices, Volumes 1-8, although it is not stated if the project triangulated or attempted to verify this data with other sources. The user must put their trust in Helbock’s faithfulness in tracking the post offices. 

The site discloses that the project team was unable to locate and map every post office mentioned in Helbock’s data set, and has placed a percentage bar on the map’s legend to indicate what percentage of the locations during a given period are unmapped. The site also acknowledges that is does not capture when an office changed names. A name change shows up as if it were a brand-new post office, with the old office "closing" and the new office "opening," even if it was the same post office in continuous operation. 

The missing data for the name changes is somewhat circumvented by the design of the map itself, which overlays the post offices at the same location to create a darker color dot, somewhat like a heat map, indicating the constant presence of a post office, regardless of name. The unmapped percentages are somewhat less effective. They remind the user that the data is incomplete, but the percentage metric is pretty ineffective in terms of visualizing the missing pieces of data, especially in a design that privileges the location metric. Can they estimate, even roughly, where these missing offices may have been located? Can they offer more details as to why they are so difficult to locate?

Many stories can be drawn from this data, combined with other data sets. First, one can track the U.S.’s westward expansion based on the sheer number of locations and the development of its information network over the 50-year span represented on the map. Second, in combining this data with data around other major historical events – the California gold rush, the building of the transcontinental railroad, and the establishment of Western port cities, for example – users could link expansion of the postal network with other major infrastructure projects in shaping the western North American continent. It appears that many defunct post offices lie in horizontal lines across the states, could these have been temporary post offices related to the building of the railroads? Was there more competition among post offices in urban, costal cities, shown by the clustered locations with multiple short-lived post offices?

This project tackles several issues related to using incomplete data sets in creating interactive archival representations. It acknowledges within the archive itself (unmapped vs. mapped percentage feature) that a portion of its data is missing – yet fails to fully elaborate or clarify which data are missing. The percentage metric is only useful in trying to visualize the magnitude of missing data. It does little to elaborate on the nature of this missing data. The name change missing data, however, is handled more skillfully by using the “heat map” overlay feature of post offices in the same location.

This project also shows how privileging different metrics of the data set affect the capacity of the audience to build stories with the data. On the map, the spatial and time-based metrics are privileged, as the post offices’ locations and dates of operation are the most visible metrics, and the ones from which the design encourages the audience to draw narratives. If this data was not mapped on top of a rendering of the U.S. west, would we immediately correlate it with other infrastructure or geographic features? What if it was mapped on a blank canvas? Would we draw other correlations or tell different stories about the expansion and contraction of an information network over time?
