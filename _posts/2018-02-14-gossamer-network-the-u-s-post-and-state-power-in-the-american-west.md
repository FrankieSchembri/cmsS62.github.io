## Gossamer Network: The U.S. Post and State Power in the American West

This [project](http://cameronblevins.org/gotp/) by Cameron Blevins (Northeastern U. and Jason Heppler, Stanford U.) is a spatial history of two of the defining projects of the late nineteenth-century United States: state formation and western expansion. Between the 1860s and the 1890s, the western United States underwent one of the most dramatic reorganizations of people, land, capital, and resources in American history. How did this happen so quickly, and across such a large and inhospitable area? Why were so many people willing and able to move to such shockingly remote places? How did the American state consolidate its control over this vast territory? The authors, both historians,  argue that the sprawling infrastructure of the U.S. Post holds the key to understanding the speed and scale of western expansion. Gossamer Network uses a database of more than 100,000 post offices to map the spread of the postal network in the western United States. This presents one of the most comprehensive and detailed spatial renderings of the nineteenth-century state that has ever been assembled.

This analysis leads to a series of new interpretations about the American state and the West. The U.S. Post was the era’s most spatially expansive institution. No other network, public or private, connected so many different people in so many different places across such a large area. It did so by operating what Blevins termed a “gossamer network.” The U.S. Post expanded across space by grafting the public functions of mail service onto the existing operations of private businesses: contracting with a stagecoach company to transport bags of mail, or paying a local businessman to periodically distribute letters from his general store. This flexible, ethereal structure allowed the U.S. Post to expand and contract across remote areas with a stunning speed. Its ability to move in lockstep with Anglo-Americans had enormous consequences for the West, accelerating a pattern of imperial conquest and settler colonialism while serving as the underlying machinery of governance in the region. Gossamer Network sheds new light on the familiar subject of western expansion and forces us to reconsider the very nature of state power during this era.
