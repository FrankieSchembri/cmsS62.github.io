Information lacking, in the authors' own words:
"In order to capture the incomplete nature of our data, the sidebar displays how many post offices are successfully mapped for a given time period and how many offices are missing from the map. 
Second, we have not captured when an office changed names. 
A name change shows up as if it were a brand-new post office, with the old office 'closing' and the new office 'opening,' even if it was the same post office in continuous operation. 
Finally, the closing date of an office represents a final date at which an office ceased to operate. Multiple openings and closings of the same office are not represented."

Missing these types of data means that the archive is emphatically focused on the service of the post itself, not necessarily the people providing/operating the service. I think this focus would lend itself well to a kind of visual survey and subsequent quantitative analysis of the postal service's crawl into the wild, wild, west.

Hovering the mouse over specific postal sites gives you the most specific information: the name of the county the post office serves and a highlighted section of the bar chart near the bottom to signify how many years the office was active. The stories of this activity are pretty abstract until placed in the specific context of the date (for example if you were trying to study the expansion of the postal system in specific communitities during the Civil War, Reconstruction, or the Guilded Age). 

This project is for the philatelist in each of us (especially for those self-identified philatelists who could place the information presented in the contexts of their own collections and augment their own stories).
