## Geography of the Post Commentary
The purpose of this project is to visualize and give context to the great expansion of the post office and to provide insight into how this expansion shaped western North America. The intended audience will likely be from academia pursing research about the history of America, or perhaps the formation of modern transportation systems that originated with the network of post offices. The platform may also be used by post office enthusiasts to engage with the past of post offices.  

There are several pieces of data that are missing from this otherwise well-populated map.  One problem was many post offices could not be located.  This incomplete data was added to the map as a small bar graph on the side that shows the percentage of data mapped and unmapped. This map also  doesn't take into account post offices that changed names, making them appear to be new offices and skewing the perception of post office growth. Considering that the post offices were found from records in the Geographic Names Information System, the data appears to be certain, although I have to wonder if the movement and expansion of towns was recorded in a way that ensures that this map is accurate. Another problem (in a way) is the focus on the West. By not including eastern post office information, part of the historical and economic narrative is missing.

As I touched on before, there is a great deal of information this map can give to us about the development of the North American West historically. This map can contribute to narratives about expansion and even of climate changes. We can map out stories based on economic booms and busts, moving city centers, war and peace, as well as droughts and years of abundance.  While those theories can't be conclusive without more information, there is no doubt there is a lot of history surrounding the post offices in our country and we can make inferences about our data. This project shows that simply extracting dates and locations from an archive can be combined to create a timeline of movement and tell stories of civilization growth.
