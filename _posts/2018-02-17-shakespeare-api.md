## API to Shakespeare's Works

The [Folger Shakespeare Library](https://www.folger.edu) in Washington, D.C. currently offers an API that allows users to acces all of Shakespeare's texts in a fine-grained manner, i.e. per line, per characters on stage for any given line, etc. The API can be accessed here: http://www.folgerdigitaltexts.org/api

The Folger is currently working on a much more comprehenisve API access but it won't be available until the fall of 2018. However, if anybody on our teams wants to work with their documents, Folger staff is happy to help. Just send me a note.
