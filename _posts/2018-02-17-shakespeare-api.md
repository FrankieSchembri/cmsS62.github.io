## API to Shakespeare's Works

The [Folger Shakespeare Library](https://www.folger.edu) in Washington, D.C. currentyl offers an API that allows you to acces all of Shakespeare's texts in a fine-grained manner, i.e. per line, the characters on stage for any given line, etc. The API can be accessed here: http://www.folgerdigitaltexts.org/api

The Folger is currently working on a much more comprehenisve API access but it won't be available until the fall of 2018. However, if anybody on our teams wants to work with the their documents, Folger staff is happy to help. Just send me a noter at fendt@mit.edu.
