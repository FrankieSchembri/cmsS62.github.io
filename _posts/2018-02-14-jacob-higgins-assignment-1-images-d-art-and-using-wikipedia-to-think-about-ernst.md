## Review of Archives



Images d'Art provides access to information in the form of a lot of images (a remarkable amount: hundreds of thousands) and provides users with handles to explore the information in structured ways.
According to their About Us section, "With the support of the Ministry of Culture and Communication, we intend to be the gateway to arts and culture by providing this experience to as many people as possible," implying a general target audience. The archive's goal to serve as a "gateway" for the arts and culture is reflected in how the images are organized and the navigational affordances of the archive.  

Tags for Authors, Period, Location, Technique, and Color provide context to the images (Color in my opinion is a seriously awesome and interesting default tag). Because the context is found in category names, users would have to bring an understanding of the different Artists, Periods, Locations, Techniques, and Colors associated with different aspects of the content. The user is able to select one of these categories or enter keywords into a search bar, but this navigation system seems designed to keep the focus on the art itself.

The digital gallery format of the archive encourages immersion in and longer-term scrolling through content. The grid system allows users to look at multiple images at once; since the user is encouraged to compare and contrast any one image to those adjacent, they're nudged to visually discover patterns/themes that connect the pieces. If a user becomes interested in the patterns they uncover, the tags that categorize the pieces then work in conjunction with the pieces themselves, becoming launching pads and hints for directions users can continue their line(s) of inquiry. 

Images d'art archive also allows users to create their own tags in the form of "collections" and "favorites" to organize the pieces according to their own patterns. 
Options to download or add the piece to collections and/or favorites are displayed varies depending on device. The mobile version's display is minimalistic and keeps attention on the art. However, how these options are displayed for images of different sizes when viewed from a web browser adds a kind of awkwardness to what otherwise could be a much more immersive and streamlined scrolling digital gallery (in my opinion).

##Impressions from Contemporary "Archives" 
I haven't really thought of social media or wikipedia as an archive in the way I've normally thought of archives in the past. 
I've been conditioned to accept the UI and affordances of each site as the only option that exists, but that's probably just because sites like Instagram, Facebook, and Wikipedia have become prototypes for what I believe social media and digital encyclopaedia's should be. Are the information management systems we use as a society of miniarchivists limiting the ways through which we consume and process information?

For this entry, I want to share some thoughts on Wikipedia specifically, and explore how I find its format connects to some of Ernst's ideas. 

Before this past week, the primary way I personally interacted with Wikipedia was through Google. I'd type a term/concept/topic into Google's search engine, and find my way to its corresponding Wikipedia page. On the page, I would probably not get too far without clicking through at least three different hyperlinks to the entries of related topics. I never looked at Wikipedia's front page or any of its "portals" to organized information, kind of randomly walking through the graph of Wikipedia articles as the topics felt relevant to my interests at the time. Pages usually contain a main article, a "see also" section with links to related pages, references, and "categories" to which the page belongs. 

In context of Ernst, this felt like a flattening of Wikipedia's achived content. It wasn't important to me  how long the pages had been sitting in memory, just that the information was being transferred when I wanted to access it. 

Collaboratively authored encyclopedia pages like those found on Wikipedia and other wikis across the internet combine the metaphorical "desire to achieve historical transparency in historiography" with the "technologically true" portrayal of reality through photographs that appear on the page. Here, even if the photograph were truly separated from "aesthetic traditions of visual mimesis, iconographic semantics, and iconic Hermeneutics" (which, I would argue, it isn't and can't), the photograph serves as one piece of evidence in the construction of a decentralized view of reality. On this digital platform, many authors are able to contribute to the rhetorical and textual construction of the topic in a way that reinforces the "reality effect" through decentralized verification and improvement of all content. 

I wish that, like the Images d'Art archive or Instagram/Facebook/etc., there were a way to save, collect, and organize articles for personal use. Currently all I've been able to see is a watchlist and a list of personal contributions, which signals to me that these features were built for those in the Wikipedia community who primarily work to make contributions to articles.
