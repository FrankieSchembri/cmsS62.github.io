##Junger Assignment 2 Comments

**Geography of the Post comments:**

The purpose of this project is to map the spread of post offices across the western united states from the 1840s until the1920s. In displaying the spread of post offices, the authors wanted to demonstrate how the spread of infrastructure influenced westward expansion and state formation. This tool is intended to display the speed and scale of western expansion to the viewer. The intended audience is someone interested in learning more about westward expansion, the west in the 1800s, or the history of post offices.

The visual includes information on the lifespan of the offices- although I think the colors chosen make it a little hard to see the distinctions and there is no definition of what is a short versus long life span. Additionally, the site tells the viewer what percent of offices are mapped for the timespan selected, telling the viewer how complete that information is. Lastly, a bar graph across the bottom of the screen shows the viewer how many post offices existed across all the years data is available. I’m not sure what their techniques were, but I’d be interested to know how they determined how many offices were unmapped.

I’d be interested to see this information paired with population data for these areas over the same time frame, or have another layer of when cities or towns were established. On its own I think it interestingly displays the increase of post offices in the west over an 80 year span; however, without more data, I don’t think this visualization can be used to create a narrative other than trends in geography of post offices.

More broadly, I think this map is a good example of the different ways to visually represent data. The interactive component means the viewer can investigate their own curiosities and essentially construct their own narrative to explore. It would have been easy to simply display a bar graph of post offices, but the layered map component gives a more nuanced view of post office expansion. And the map incorporates a variety of factors- time, geography, density, duration, etc.


**Graphesis, Johanna Drucker comments:**

In Graphesis, Drucker explores how visuals construct and control our relationship to knowledge. In the introduction I was struck by her observation that screens “structure our relation to knowledge visually.” This reminded me of an in class discussion with Ari Daniel, who produces multimedia science stories. One thing he talked about is how Facebook has changed the way videos are produced. Because these videos are largely for a social media audience, they have to engage viewers through the restrictions of that platform. The videos have to be highly visual and often need interesting captions/subtitles, as many people don’t listen to the audio of a video until they’ve become interested in the content. The most important and engaging detail needs to be in the first five seconds, otherwise people keep scrolling. The way informational videos and short documentaries are being produced and the way the information they contain is being displayed is directly impacted by the media through which it is displayed. Facebook layouts are dictating how news organizations are able to communicate with their audience.


In the “Visualizing uncertainty and interpretative cartography” section Drucker explores how information is related to the visual. The observation isn’t the same as the phenomena, information collected is dependent on biases and objectives and the way it’s displayed adds another layer of biases and objectives on top of that. Therefore, the knowledge derived from graphic representations is dependent on interpretation, not on the actual phenomenon. “ But the rendering of statistical information into graphical form gives it a simplicity and legibility that hides every aspect of the original interpretative framework on which the statistical data were constructed.” She uses gender as an example; even though the olympics will only collect and categorize gender as a binary, that doesn’t make gender a binary or represent the reality of athletes’ genders. Acknowledging how data is constructed- the biases in its collection and display- allowed the viewer to more accurately interpret the data, to accept the ambiguity and better relate it to the actual phenomenon.

**Digital Humanities comments:**

In the “Visualization and Data Design” section Burdick explores what it means to express intellectual concepts visually, to make a visual argument. Visual displays, while presented as objective, are often misleading; instead of objective displays, they are rhetorical constructs. Visualization is distinct from illustration. Illustration is secondary to text, while visualization encompasses the argument the author is trying to make. Visualizations are traditionally charts, diagrams, grids, or trees; however, many new forms of digital data representation are being developed. “Experimental visualization uses movement through the time and space of a three-dimensional world as the primary mode of engagement.” Using data visualization can reveal relationships and knowledge that are more difficult to discover textually. Burdick states visuals are most effective when used in dialogue with traditional methods. Understanding visuals and being able to read them is essential for digital literacy and obtaining knowledge in new and changing formats.
