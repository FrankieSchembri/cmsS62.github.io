*Review of Archives* 

*[Archive of our Own](archiveofourown.org)* is a fanfiction "archive" for authors to post their work and share them. It's comlpletely fan-moderated and fan-run. I chose *Archive of our Own* as it presents an interesting twist on the word "archive". Archives generally refer to some curated collection of "old" and/or "distinguished" work. However, this self-proclaimed archive very much thrives off of new content posted by fans - which often times may be their only credential. In addition, there is no "curation". It's much more akin to *DeviantArt* or *Wattpad* and other similar sites that allow for any user to post their work. At best, there is self-curation as users choose what they want to post. So in what ways is *Archive of our Own* an archive? Does it "qualify"? It doesn't really follow many conventional associations tied to archives, but it is a collection of textual work.

*Archive of Our Own*'s (henceforth abbreviated as AO3) front page does not display any of its contributor's work, but rather briefly explains its purpose, provides a screen with different genres, news, and tweets. It almost promotes itself as an institution/entity with the current news and tweets section. Tweets are from it's "subcommittees" which are never really defined anywhere. A community is further emphasized with the description of the benefits of having an AO3 account, such as receiving notifications and participating in challenges. 

Viewing the fandom page shows a depiction of the top fandoms/genres in boxes and top or popular shows/categories within those genres. For example, under the fandom Anime & Manga, the top five shows/categories listed below are: _Haikyuu!!_, _Attack on Titan_, _Naruto_, _Yuri!!! on Ice_, and _Hetalia_. By each, listed in parenthesis, is the count of works in each of those categories. It pulls users towards the popular subjects, but without over inundating the screen with information. Creating a rather clean interface that clearly defines the different fandoms/genres. It can be argued that the organization by fandom and show/category is a form of curation. This organization imagines the user to be looking for something particularly related to a show or fandom. 

On the other hand, a user can also browse all works by recent. So if a user has no particular direction in mind, the user can see quick listings of recently uploaded work. Listings also depict quite a bit of information (See figure 1 below).

Works are tagged with tags that can relate to content, characters, setting, and more. The symbols on the side very clearly depicts some categorizations - but requires some prior knowledge to understand. (Users can click on the icon to read a blurb about the meaning of the symbols). A quick blurb also gives a sense of what the work might be about. Other logistical details that assist in whether the work is relevant/interesting to the user such as language and chapters are clearly depicted in a physically unique location. 

Overall, AO3 very clearly depicts and marks each of its works. It imagines users to either be looking for something relating to a subject/show/fandom or be looking to contribute to a subject/show/fandom. Works are technically related by base subject matter, but it's an interesting exercise to think about the purpose of the archive. It doesn't seem to strive to push any particular goal, but rather to provide an easy platform for consumption. It's purpose is perhaps different from what is generally attached to the concept of an "archive", which often harkens to historical materials or literature studied by scholars and used in research papers. Would you accept AO3 as an archive?
