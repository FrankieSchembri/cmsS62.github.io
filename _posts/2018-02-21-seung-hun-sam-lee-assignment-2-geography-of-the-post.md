Geography of the Post project maps out post offices in western half of the United States during 1846-1902, at the height of nation's western expansion, in a nice dark interactive map dotted by bright green dots representing different post offices. The purpose of this map is to analyze the nature of the United States' western expansion: What was the western expansion? Why did it happen? How did it happen so quickly? The map looks at the role of the post office in the western expansion as settlements extended out west across barren lands. The intended audience seem to be academics studying the history of the western expansion as well as general public who might find this map fascinating.

The map is not quite an archive in the sense that it has extensive data regarding the post offices. In fact, the map is missing a lot of data, including the locations for 29% of the post offices during the period, which the creators of the map were not able to find. The map also does not have much data about the post offices themselves, and only lists the post offices' location, opening date and closing date. Only certain data that they have are the closing dates, opening dates and locations, which can also be questionable, since the source of information for the map comes from a book written in the 21st century about establishments in 19th century when information technology did not come close to what it is now.

However, even with the lack of information about the post offices themselves, we can weave several different kind of stories or narratives using this data. We can talk about the trails that the settlers used to traverse from the east to the west, and how some of the trails died out as the stream of settlers has decreased by looking at opening and closing of post offices through some notable trails. We can also get an insight into rise and fall of towns and cities as industries in the west shifted from gold to others like agricultural and commerce.

An important to point to note while looking at this project is that the archive does not have to be extensive to create interesting representations or tell stories. As far as I can tell, all the data for the project comes from 8 volumes of books with somewhat limited amount of information. However, the creators of the project were able to create a visibly intricate map where the viewers are able to infer various aspects of the western expansion, analyzed by time and location. Even though the project originates from an archive with somewhat questional data, the project creates a clear and easy-to-understand visualization.
