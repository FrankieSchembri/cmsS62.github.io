## Junger- Ernst

Ernst's reading focuses on how modern technology- computers, social media, video cameras, etc.- have changed the way archives work. One way is that now there is no time gap between when events happen and when they are documented. Events are live streamed- instantly recorded and stored, a picture or a blog recapping an event can be posted in a matter of seconds. "The notion of immediate data feedback replaces the data separation that traditionally made all the 'archival' difference. 

Erns points out that one of the concequences of such immediate archival power is that it transforms archiving from a cultural record to "a performative form of memory as communication". We display our memory to communicate with one another, thereby archiving our experiences. This also means archives shift from eternity to immediacy. Not only the greats will be remembered anymore. Everyone can- and most are- archived, through facebook, twitter, instagram, or other digital record keeping services.
