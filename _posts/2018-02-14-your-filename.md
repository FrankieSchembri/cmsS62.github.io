## A New Post
## Junger Week 1- Archive

I looked at the Museum of Modern Art archive. The home page has changing images advertising their exhibits, so the viewer is immediately encouraged to consider visiting the museum. The design of the website itself is very minimal- just black text on a white background; the hot pink "buy tickets" option stands out- once again emphasising visiting the museum itself. Of the five options at the top of the page, two deal with visiting the museum "plan your visit" and "exhibitions and events". The third "Art and artists" gives you access to the online archive/collection of the work. A search is prominent, inviting the user to explore. Although, there aren't any suggested topics or searches, so the viewer is left to navigate the 200,000 works of art by themselves. The viewer can explore the visual art collection and a list of artists. There is also an audio option, where select works have recordings explaining the piece paired with the art.

The archive seems aimed more at getting viewers to visit the museum than interesting them in exploring the art collected online. The main page definitely has an emphasis on planning a visit, buying tickets,and events. Meanwhile, the archive itself is a lot less directed or guided. I would have liked for them to have topics, periods, or suggestions that the user to click on to get started. It does have a filter that lets you pick the type of art and period. Diving into 200,000 works with no guidelines is intimidating if you don't know what you're looking for.

The intended audience is anyone interested in the art that has been displayed at MOMA, especially people interested in visiting MOMA. There is not much narrative for viewers to follow online.
