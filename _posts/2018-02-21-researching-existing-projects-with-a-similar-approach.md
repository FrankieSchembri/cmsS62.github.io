**Hessische Landesbibliothek (State library of Hesse, Germany)**

One example of huge archives most students get confronted with are libraries. Most major cities with universities in Germany have central libraries. Students often still depend a lot on analogue books rather than digital copies. Even if in most cases there is a digital system, finding the right books can be a pain due to the lack of clarity and usability of the systems.
In 2013 a team in Darmstadt and Frankfurt tried to find new ways of making finding the right books easier - leading to better, more convenient results. The key feature of their concept was the usage of context-sensitive facetes (categories) to help the user narrow his results down. The general Idea was that the user didn't need to know the title or author anymore to find a book with just a few clicks. He could e.g. just search for 'informatics'. The system would then show him all the results of informatics books accomplished by factetes such as 'PHP', 'Java', 'Software Architecture' etc. Clicking on one of the facetes would result in more specific results (books) as well as new, more exact facetes to narrow the results down even further.


**Stadel Museum Frankfurt**

In 2014 I was involved as a research assistant in a project of my [former university](https://ikum.mediencampus.h-da.de/) in collaboration with [Staedel museum frankfurt](http://www.staedelmuseum.de/en). The overall goal was to extend a visit at the museum into the digital. Providing background information as well as making exhibits accessible which could not be included into the current exhibition.
What made the project interesting to us (as researchers in the fields of interactive media design) was finding new ways of raising interest of random visitors for the collection. This especially included visitors who are not willing to spend much time searching for specific artworks or reading generic texts. Therefore we played around with personalised and highly adaptive user interfaces. The presented artworks could change depending on the visitors own likes in the past as well as adapting to the keywords he was searching for. Additionally we put a lot of thought into supporting serendipity by engaging the user to stroll around ("schlendern") to be able to explore new artworks and thereby avoid filter bubbles.
Due to the different objectives of different stakeholders and because our part of the research project was more focused on basic research we were rather focused on creating and testing many different approaches than actually implementing one specific concept to a full. Furthermore the work of the team I was working in became visible more in the scientific papers (see [here](https://www.fbi.h-da.de/fileadmin/personal/b.humm/Publikationen/Deuschel_et_al_-_The_Digital_Online_Museum__SDA_2014_.pdf) and [here](https://www.degruyter.com/view/j/iwp.2015.66.issue-4/iwp-2015-0046/iwp-2015-0046.xml?rskey=3gyvWL&result=1)) we published than the public result (which can be found [here](https://sammlung.staedelmuseum.de))
