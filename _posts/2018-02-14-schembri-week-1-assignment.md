## Review of Archive: Authorial London

My general expectation of any archive is that it stores some kind of accumulated information in one place and presents in it a way that is useful to some interested party. This website certainly does this - it has aggregated information about famous English authors and arranged it on a spatial plane. Tt has aggregated mentions of locations within the city of London in works by and about 47 famous English authors, including Virginia Woolf and Charles Dickens, and mapped dots corresponding to these mentions on a map of the city iself. It also provides biographies and full lists of works of each author. 

The intended audience of this archive seems to be anyone interested in learning about the actual settings that inspired and housed a number of famous English authors within the same city. It could also be useful for anyone reading a particular author and looking to understand the actual location of a place referenced in one of their works. It could also serve any literature enthusiasts who might be planning a trip to London. Finally, it would also be useful for future generations looking to recreate the sites of London no longer present in the city as it is now constructed. 

Upon arriving at the site, visitors are greeted with a pop-up window over the map that serves both as a introduction and instructional manual for navigating the site. Users can opt to hide this pop-up for subsequent visits. This is, in my opinion, a great feature, and one that provides the user with explanations about what kind of information the archive can provide, and what tools it is providing with which the user may sort and filter this information. One might argue that this could restrict the kind of experience users may have while navigating the site, as it implicitly assumes a certain kind of need within the user and suggests which paths would best fit this need.

In this particular case, I prefer greater instruction at the risk of narrowing the potential exploration of the archive, as it lowers the angle of the learning curve for the casual visitor and makes them instantly aware of the tools in their toolbelt, some of which might have otherwise gone unused.  

In terms of inviting exploration, it would have been perhaps nice to include a "Google Street View"-esque feature to allow the user to enter a photographic experience of the places at the ground level, so as to better put themselves in the shoes of the authors. I acknowledge, however, that this would require a greater deal of computing capability than the website's creators wanted to invest in the site.

I think the filters for searching for locations provide a great deal of paths for exploration - one can sort by author, by period, by genre of work, by form, even by socioeconomic class of the author. The map doesn't respond to all of the gestures expected by most modern computer users, i.e. the zoom feature is a button that must be clicked manually, but it is for the most part very user friendly. It gets the archives main point across beautifully - that many of these authors did indeed, literally, cross paths in London.

## Archive I like: The Office Time Machine

This is one of my favorite digital archives - simply because its sorting feature is so creative and presents an entirely perspective with which to view the source material. The [Office Time Machine](http://theofficetimemachine.com/) takes the video related to every pop culture reference made during the television show "The Office," and sorts them into individual Youtube videos based on the year the thing being referenced was created. For example,  the video titled "1970" includes references to the Orville Redenbacher popcorn company, The Doobie Brothers, "Signed, Sealed, Delivered," by Stevie Wonder, and Earth Day. 

The interface is very simple, just a search bar at the top into which the user can type any year, and the embedded Youtube video. If there are no references (compiled by the author of the site) related to a year of interest, the video returned is a generic "Sorry, nothing from this year," message. Users must put some amount of faith in the creator's ability to spot references in the show, obtain the related clips, and date the reference, less they fact-check the information themselves. That said, even if the creator missed some references or got a couple wrong, this archive provides a fascinating look at a widely popular television show from the mid-2000s into the 2010s. 

The fact that the humor and the narrative arcs of The Office depend so much on an assumed knowledge by the audience of certain cultural touchstones makes this archive so rich and interesting. The references do not appear chronologically in the show in terms of their source material's development across human history. They are blended and appear chronologically only in respect to the narrative timeline of the show itself, and therefore show how deeply reliant pop culture and comedy in the Western world have become on a common cultural memory. 

It's a lot of fun to play around.

## Ernst Reading

This reading brings up many foundational ideas in the realm of digital archives and media archeology. Ernst discusses how the infrastructure of digital spaces has transformed the way archives are created, maintained, and used with respect to notions of an analog archive. Most notably, he brings up the idea of computer memory and computer storage with respect to information management, and how the time it takes to retrieve information has been so shortened by this technology, archives are now almost always in motion. Digitalization has collapsed the binary between stored information and information in motion/trasmission. The web ecosystem has allowed for a flattening of the temporal dimension of information and for its spatial dimension - it can be anywhere at once, and accessed/modified at any time.
