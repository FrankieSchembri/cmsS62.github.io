## International Tracing Service

The International Tracing Service archives the narrative of individuals persecuted during the Holocaust. In doing this, it keeps history alive and provides a variety of information sources. The intended audience is probably both individuals looking to understand their or their family history. As a result, this would also serve well researchers looking to construct a better understanding of the stories of people affected by the Holocaust. The archive provides paratext in explicitly stating its purpose. I think this is essential for this archive more so than others. The Holocaust personally affected many people, and these people’s investment in learning about their family members’ stories could be vastly different from researchers’ approaches. As a result, by specifying their audience very clearly, the archive sets out clear expectations. It also provides articles which draw from the contents of the archives.

The headings on the landing page are clear and accessible. The digital archive centers around a search bar. This works well with their stated purpose, which is to help individuals/families looking for information on particular people/family members. On the other hand, it does not promote discovery. I am not sure, however, whether that is as important a metric for this particular archive, give that the primary purpose is search (and not research, in an academic sense).

## HathiTrust

HathiTrust has only a search bar and some vague introductions: “The HathiTrust Research Center helps researchers meet the technical challenges of dealing with massive amounts of digital text.” I have no idea what kind of content it even contains. “Hathi” means elephant in Hindi, and the logo is an elephant, so maybe it’s all about elephants? With that said, I think it is also unlikely that you would chance upon this website out of the blue — even going to that page suggests that you came upon it somewhere (likely not a random website generator), so you probably have a goal in mind or have some context from the page that led you there. With that said, that is insufficient reason to have such a bare interface. I wasn’t as viscerally bothered by this page as I have been by others, though, because the overall layout is still pleasing to the eye and doesn’t look like it is from the 1990s.

Upon clicking on “Collections,” you get a fuller picture of what sorts of collections this page has. “Featured Collections” shows a non-specific sampling, which allows you to explore whatever you would like to.
